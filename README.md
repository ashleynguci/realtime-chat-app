# realtime-chat-app

This is my final project for mobile programming course at Haaga-Helia.  
Using React Native (Hook), Socket.IO, Nodejs, Redux, react-navigation, and Gifted Chat UI.

    ```sh
    # Type on Terminal to find the IP address, it looks like that: inet 192.168.0.100 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.0.255. Take the 192.168.0.100 part/
    ifconfig (for iOS)
    ipconfig
    ```

    ```sh
    # in chat-socket.io/App.js/ line 13, change the IP that you found above, and add to the link below, remember add :3001 at the end
    const socket = io("http://192.168.0.100:3001");
